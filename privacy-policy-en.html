            <p>When required by applicable law, VIP may disclose your personal information without further consent.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Information Not Requiring Consent</h3>
            <p>We may share anonymous information with third parties (such as advertisers on our website) in aggregate form for commercial purposes; we may share general usage trends of our services with them, such as the number of customers in a specific group of people purchasing certain products or engaging in certain transactions.</p>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, VIP may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent when and to the extent explicitly permitted by local data protection laws (for example, to follow a subpoena), and when we may believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, to investigate fraud or to respond to a government request.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
            <h3>4.1 VIP's Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have implemented reasonable physical, electronic and management process measures to protect the information we collect from your products and VIP websites. We will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information.</p>
            <p>All your personal information is stored on secure servers and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your data based on its importance and sensitivity, and guarantee that your personal information has the highest security level. We guarantee that employees and third-party service providers who access this information to help provide you with products and services have strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to fulfill these obligations, they will be subject to disciplinary action or terminated. In short, we regularly review information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent any unauthorized access and use.</p>
            <p>We will take all feasible measures to protect your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not always secure, therefore, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transmitted in both directions over the Internet.</p>

            <h3>4.2 What You Need to Do</h3>
            <p>You can play a role in protecting the security of your personal information by not disclosing your login password or account information to anyone (unless this person is formally authorized by you). VIP is not responsible for security loopholes caused by third-party access to your personal information resulting from your failure to maintain the privacy of your personal information. Notwithstanding the above provisions, if any unauthorized use of your account by other users of the Internet or any other security breach occurs, you must notify us immediately. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Retention Policy</h3>
            <p>We will retain personal information as long as necessary to achieve the purpose of collecting information, or to comply with applicable legal requirements or permissions. As long as it can be reasonably inferred that retaining personal information cannot achieve the purpose of collecting personal information, and it is no longer necessary to retain information for legal, dispute resolution, enforcement of our agreements or other commercial purposes, we will no longer retain personal information, or will eliminate the means of associating personal information with a specific person.</p>

            <h2>5. How You Can Manage Your Personal Information</h2>

For more details related to personal information in your VIP account, you can access and change it by logging into your account through your device.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Withdrawal of Consent</h3>

We will process your request within a reasonable time after you make the request, and will no longer collect, use and/or disclose your personal information according to your request. Please note that withdrawing your consent will lead to certain legal consequences. Depending on the extent to which you withdraw your consent for us to process your personal information, this may mean that you cannot enjoy VIP's products and services.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>If we need to transfer personal information outside your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliates or third-party service providers, we will notify you sufficiently and obtain your authorization in accordance with applicable laws. By implementing appropriate security measures, we guarantee that all such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection laws and will not change our commitment to comply with this privacy policy to protect your personal information.</p>

            <h3>5.4 Personal Information Subject Account Deletion</h3>
